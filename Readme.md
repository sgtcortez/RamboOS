# Introduction

This is just a hobby operating system that I am doing on my spare time.   
I have always liked operating system, and, I know how hard it would be to create one from scratch, but, this is too fun and, gives you a lot of acknowledge, that, pays the price ...

All the code is very well documented, but, documented for me ...


# Compile

To compile, ensure that you have the Asssembler NASM, and, you are on Linux ...    
Then, just type: 
```shell
make 
```
It will compile all the sources needed by the Operating System ... Kernel, Drivers, Bootloaders and etc ...

# Run

To run, you can use [**qemu**](https://www.qemu.org/).   
It does not work in virtual box for now ...

Just type:  
```shell
make run
```
